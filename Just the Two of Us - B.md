## Lyrics

### Verse 1

l1: I see the crystal raindrops fall

l1: And the beauty of it all

l1: Is when the sun comes shining through

l1: To make those rainbows in my mind

l1: When I think of you sometime

l1: And I wanna spend some time with you

### Chorus 1

l1: Just the two of us

l1: We can make it if we try

l1: Just the two of us

l1: (Just the two of us)

l1: Just the two of us

l1: Building castles in the sky

l1: Just the two of us

l1: You and I

### Verse 2

l1: We look for love, no time for tears

l1: Wasted water's all that is

l1: And it don't make no flowers grow

l1: Good things might come to those who wait

l1: Not for those who wait too late

l1: We gotta go for all we know

### Chorus 2

l1: Just the two of us

l1: We can make it if we try

l1: Just the two of us

l1: (Just the two of us)

l1: Just the two of us

l1: Building them castles in the sky

l1: Just the two of us

l1: You and I

### Verse 2

l1: I hear the crystal raindrops fall

l1: On the window down the hall

l1: And it becomes the morning dew

l1: And darling when the morning comes

l1: And I see the morning sun

l1: I wanna be the one with you

### Chorus 3

l1: Just the two of us

l1: We can make it if we try

l1: Just the two of us

l1: (Just the two of us)

l1: Just the two of us

l1: Building big castles way on high

l1: Just the two of us

l1: You and I

### Chorus 4 / Outro

l1: just the two of us

l1: (We can make it, just the two of us)

l1: Let's get it together baby (yeah)

l1: (Just the two of us)

l1: Just the two of us

l1: (We can make it, just the two of us)

l1: (Just the two of us)

l1: (We can make it, just the two of us)

l1: (Just the two of us)

l1: (We can make it, just the two of us)

l1: (Just the two of us)

l1: (We can make it, just the two of us)
