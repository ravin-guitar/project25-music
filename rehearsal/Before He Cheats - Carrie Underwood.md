## Before He Cheats - Carrie Underwood

### Verse 1

l1: Right now, he's probably slow dancing

l1: With a bleached-blond tramp

l1: And she's probably getting frisky

l1: Right now, he's probably buying her some fruity little drink

l1: 'Cause she can't shoot a whiskey

l1: Right now, he's probably up behind her with a pool stick

l1: Showing her how to shoot a combo

l1: And he don't know


l1: I dug my key into the side

l1: Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive

l1: Carved my name into his leather seats

l1: I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights

l1: Slashed a hole in all four tires

l1: Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats


l1: Right now, she's probably up singing some

l1: White-trash version of Shania karaoke

l1: Right now, she's probably saying, "I'm drunk"

l1: Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive

l1: Carved my name into his leather seats

l1: I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights

l1: Slashed a hole in all four tires

l1: 'Cause I dug my key into the side

l1: Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
