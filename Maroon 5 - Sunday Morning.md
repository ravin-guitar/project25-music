## Lyrics

### A

l1: Sunday morning, rain is falling

l1: Steal some covers, share some skin (I like that)

l1: Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable

l1: You twist to fit the mold that I am in

### B

l1: But things just get so crazy

l1: Living life gets hard to do

l1: And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew

l1: That someday it would lead me back to you

l1: That someday it would lead me back to you (oh, someday)

### C

l1: That may be all I need

l1: In darkness, she is all I see (all I see)

l1: Come and rest your bones with me

l1: Driving slow on Sunday morning

l1: And I never want to leave

### A2

l1: Yeah, fingers trace your every outline, oh yeah, yeah

l1: Yeah, paint a picture with my hand, oh, woah

l1: And back and forth we sway like branches in a storm

l1: Change the weather, still together when it ends

### C2

l1: That may be all I need (all I need)

l1: In darkness, she is all I see

l1: Come and rest your bones with me

l1: Driving slow on Sunday morning

l1: And I never want to leave

### B2

l1: But things just get so crazy living

l1: Life gets hard to do (life gets hard)

l1: Sunday morning rain is falling and I'm calling out to you

l1: Singing, someday it'll bring me back to you

l1: Yeah (someday oh, someday oh)

l1: Find a way to bring myself back home to you

l1: You may not know

### C3 (这个暂时不唱)

l1: That may be all I need

l1: In darkness, she is all I see (you are all I see)

l1: Come and rest your bones with me

l1: Driving slow on Sunday morning, driving slow

l1: Yeah, yeah

l1: Ah, yeah, yeah

l1: Ah, yeah, yeah

l1: Ah, yeah, yeah

l1: Ah, yeah, yeah

l1: Ah, yeah, yeah

l1: There's a flower in your hair

l1: I'm a flower in your hair

l1: Oh, yeah, yeah

l1: Yeah, yeah, oh

l1: Woah, oh, yeah

l1: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

l1: (All I need)

l1: (All I see)
