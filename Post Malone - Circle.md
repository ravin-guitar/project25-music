## Verse 2

Let go

I got a feeling that it's time to let go

I say so

I knew that this was doomed from the get-go

You thought that it was special, special

But it was just the sex though, the sex though

And I still hear the echoes (the echoes)

I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go

## Chorus 2

Seasons change and our love went cold

Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go

Run away, but we're running in circles

Run away, run away

I dare you to do something

I'm waiting on you again

So I don't take the blame

Run away, but we're running in circles

Run away, run away, run away

## Bridge

Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through

It's only me

What you got to lose?

Make up your mind, tell me

What are you gonna do?

It's only me

Let it go

## Chorus 3

Seasons change and our love went cold

Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go

Run away, but we're running in circles

Run away, run away

I dare you to do something

I'm waiting on you again

So I don't take the blame

Run away, but we're running in circles

Run away, run away, run away
